[CEO]: We had a strong quarter with a 12% increase in vehicle deliveries. Our new electric SUV line was particularly well-received in both domestic and international markets, exceeding our forecasts.

[CFO]: Operating income remained stable. We are investing in AI-driven logistics and automation to improve our supply chain efficiency. While this impacted short-term margins slightly, we expect long-term savings and scalability.

[Analyst]: Could you clarify how inflation is affecting your capital expenditure?

[CFO]: Certainly. Inflation has led to higher costs in certain raw materials, especially lithium and copper. However, we’ve managed to offset some of these through long-term contracts and improved procurement strategies.

[CEO]: I’ll add that despite macroeconomic pressures, our capital expenditure plans remain on track. We're prioritizing technology and sustainability projects that are critical to our five-year roadmap.

[Analyst]: Can you provide any guidance for the next quarter?

[CFO]: We’re projecting moderate revenue growth in the 6–8% range, driven by seasonal demand and expansion into Southeast Asian markets. Operating margin is expected to remain within the 10–12% band.

[CEO]: Looking ahead, we’re excited about upcoming product launches and partnerships in the renewable energy sector. We continue to monitor risks closely but remain confident in our long-term growth strategy.
